**Project Overview:**
This project is based on the MovieLens 25M dataset and incorporates extensive data processing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning to build a sophisticated movie recommendation system. Key functionalities include data merging, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and prediction model implementation.

**Installation:**
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. The project relies on several Python libraries, which can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise plotly
```

**Data Setup:**
1. Download the MovieLens 25M dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/).
2. Unzip the dataset into a directory named `ml-25m` within the project's root directory.
3. Check that `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, and `tags.csv` are present within the `ml-25m` directory.

**Usage:**
- **Notebook Navigation**: Open the Jupyter Notebook (`rc.ipynb`). The notebook is divided into sections that are labeled with comments to guide through the processes like loading data, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Running Analysis**: Execute the cells in sequence to load data, merge datasets, and perform data preprocessing. Each cell is documented to explain its purpose.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Follow the sections that guide through training different machine learning models. Adjust parameters as needed to experiment with different model configurations.
- **Visualization**: Execute visualization cells to generate plots that help in understanding the data and the effectiveness of different models.

**Machine Learning Models:**
The project utilizes several machine learning models:
- Collaborative filtering models from the Surprise library such as SVD and SVDpp.
- Traditional machine learning models from Scikit-Learn for various predictive tasks.
- Custom algorithms for calculating weighted ratings based on user and movie metadata.

**Visualization:**
This project may use Plotly for interactive plots (if uncommented). Ensure Plotly is correctly set up and refer to the specific cells to generate visual insights from the data.

**Contributing:**
Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request with a clear explanation of your modifications or additions.
